OVERVIEW
========

This is the source code of several heuristic search algorithms and test
domains used for the experiments described in the AAAI-10 paper ``Searching
Without a Heuristic: Efficient Use of Abstraction'' by Bradford Larsen, Ethan
Burns, Wheeler Ruml, and Robert Holte.

The test domains include the fifteen puzzle, the macro fifteen puzzle, the
glued fifteen puzzle, and the fourteen pancake puzzle.  The algorithms include
A*, Hierarchical A*, IDA*, Hierarchical IDA*, and Switchback.  Instances for
these domains are found in the `testdata` subdirectory.


BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

The code is written in C++ and has been built succcessfully on several flavors
of Linux, as well as Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7.

You will at least version 1.41 of the Boost libraries to build this code.

This project is built using Boost Jam.  If you have Boost Jam version
3-something, simply run 'bjam' in the top-level directory:

    bjam      # build the search code

If everything worked, there should be a binary at
build/TOOLSET-NAME/spacerelease/search under the top-level directory, where
TOOLSET-NAME is platform-specific.  (For example, on Mac OS X 10.6.6, we have
seen TOOLSET-NAME be `darwin-4.2.1`.)


USAGE
=====

To run the code one must specify the search domain, algorithm, and input.  For
example, to solve instance number 55 of the fifteen puzzle:

   $ ./build/spacerelease/search tiles astar testdata/korf100/55
