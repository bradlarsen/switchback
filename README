OVERVIEW
========

This is the source code of several heuristic search algorithms and test
domains used for the experiments described in the AAAI-10 paper ``Searching
Without a Heuristic: Efficient Use of Abstraction'' by Bradford Larsen, Ethan
Burns, Wheeler Ruml, and Robert Holte.

The test domains include the fifteen puzzle, the macro fifteen puzzle, the
glued fifteen puzzle, and the fourteen pancake puzzle.  The algorithms include
A*, Hierarchical A*, IDA*, Hierarchical IDA*, and Switchback.  Instances for
these domains are found in the `testdata` subdirectory.


BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

The code is written in C++ and has been built succcessfully on several flavors
of Linux, as well as Mac OS X 10.6.

Run the following in the top-level directory of the extracted tarball:

    tar xfj boost_1_41_0.tar.bz2    # extract and build Boost; takes a while
    cd boost_1_41_0
    sh bootstrap.sh
    ./bjam

    ./bjam ../                      # build the search code

If this all worked, there should be a binary at
build/TOOLSET-NAME/spacerelease/search under the top-level directory, where
TOOLSET-NAME is platform-specific; for example, on Mac OS X 10.6.6, we have
seen TOOLSET-NAME be `darwin-4.2.1`, and on various flavors of Linux it has
been some version of gcc.


USAGE
=====

To run the code one must specify the search domain, algorithm, and input.  For
example, to solve instance number 55 of the fifteen puzzle:

   $ ./build/spacerelease/search tiles astar testdata/korf100/55
